# BeginnerJava

Hi!
This is my Java code from when I was learning Java. I have some basic exercises and notes that you might find useful. It's written in Spanish and a little English, just for practice :)

It's important to know that Spanish is my first language, so sorry for my not-so-great English.

At present, it's not too bad :)
Cheers
